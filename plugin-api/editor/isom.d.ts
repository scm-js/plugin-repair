/**
 * The isometric terrain brush — StarEdit's, as reverse-engineered for Chkdraft
 * (Justin Forsberg, MIT; src/mapping_core/{sc,scenario,chk}.{h,cpp}).
 * Upstream: https://github.com/TheNitesWhoSay/Chkdraft
 * Full provenance and license notice: ../../ATTRIBUTION.md
 *
 * The model: a lattice of diamonds, each 4 tiles wide and 2 tall, centred on the
 * corners of the ISOM rect grid (a rect is a 2x1 tile pair; diamond (x, y) is centred
 * on the top-left corner of rect (x, y), so only (x + y) even are diamonds). A diamond
 * has one ISOM value, stored redundantly in the four rects it overlaps — two u16 per
 * rect, `(value << 4) | flags`, the flags saying which quadrant of which diamond the
 * u16 belongs to. `value` is a row of the shape-link table: one row per flat terrain,
 * fourteen per cliff/edge set (one per shape: four edges, four outer and four inner
 * corners, two straights).
 *
 * The shape-link table is derived from the CV5 at load time (`isomTables`): each
 * tile group carries four ISOM links, and the fourteen shape definitions say which
 * link pattern belongs in which quadrant of which shape. Only the terrain-type
 * numbering and the adjacency lists (`data/isomTables.ts`) had to be copied in.
 *
 * Painting (`paintIsom`) sets the brush diamonds to the terrain's value, then walks
 * outward: each neighbouring diamond is re-picked as the table row that agrees with
 * the most of its four neighbours (a terrain that cannot touch the new one becomes
 * the intermediate terrain, which is why the brush bleeds). Finally every touched rect
 * is turned back into tiles by hashing its four links and looking the hash up among
 * the CV5 groups, with cliff faces continued upward along the groups' stack links.
 *
 * Everything here mutates the scenario in place and returns the change lists, in the
 * same `{ at, before, after }` form as the tile brushes so one history entry undoes
 * both `tiles` and `isom`.
